## Recent
I am currently maintaining three Dart/Flutter packages:
1. [positioned_scroll_observer](https://github.com/SimonWang9610/indexed_scroll_observer), which allows scrolling to a specific index in any Flutter scroll view not limited to `ListView` and `GridView`. 
2. [simple_http_api](https://github.com/SimonWang9610/api), which extends the official Dart HTTP package with the ability of cancelation, timeout, and EventSource, supporting streaming http repsonses from servers, e.g., streaming ChatGPT API.
3. [relative_stack](https://github.com/SimonWang9610/relative_stack), which position widgets relative to your specific widgets, instead of using explicit positions in `Stack`.
3. [flutter_gpt_tokenizer](https://github.com/SimonWang9610/gpt_tokenizer), which enables deverlopers to encode/decode their prompts for ChatGPT APIs, so that they could count the lenght of tokens for prompts(sentences/words) and then call ChatGPT APIs more efficiently. This package utitlizes Dart FFI to bridge the BPE tokenizer (written in Rust) that uses the tiktoken files from [OpenAI tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken)

## Application Development

The most frequent technology I am using is <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Flutter-02569B?style=for-the-badge&logo=flutter&logoColor=white"> for developing cross-platform applications. You could find my personl Flutter projects in my Github, like:
1. [messaging](https://github.com/SimonWang9610/messaging) is a chat application purely based on firesbase and supports caching conversations/messages in local database (SQLite) on Android/iOS. In further, it would support chatting with a chatbot (based on ChatGPT API).
2. [weaver_editor](https://github.com/SimonWang9610/weaver-editor) is a prototyped rich text editor purely using Dart, supporting block-style editing and SlatJS protocol, although it is discontinued now.
3. [flutter_video_call](https://github.com/SimonWang9610/flutter-video-call) is a video call application using flutter_webrtc for the applications and has two kinds (in different branches) of Node.js servers to ensble rtc calling based on WebSocket: 
    - using Agora SDK
    - building a MediaServer using kurento.


Meanwhile, I am also proficient with developing API servers using <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-339933?style=for-the-badge&logo=nodedotjs&logoColor=white"></img>.

## Other activities
Apart from `Flutter` and `Node.js`, I also used <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=#E57324"> to build a convolutional nerual network from scratch, see [cnn](https://github.com/SimonWang9610/cnn)

By using `Rust` and `JavaScript`, I converted a quantized CNN model into <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/WebAssembly-654FF0?style=for-the-badge&logo=WebAssembly&logoColor=white"> and then deployed the model on the web, although it was just prototyped.
